[] Check that strings are not urls or email addresses (or phone numbers?) - don't translate if so
[] NonMemoizedMarkdown is leaking a tailwind config string
[] Would be nice to have a way to mark strings not to extract/rewrite (e.g. "helpmefind.ai" - not a url but also not translatable)
[] Support decorator to translate strings inside non-JSX JS objects
[] Generalize to react-auto-intl. Support other libraries like react-intl, i18next, etc.
[] Let most of the functions like translateComponent be overridable in Configuration object, but default to next-auto-intl's implementation. Allows dev to override any part of the logic
[] Support ternary operators inside JSX (e.g. {isLoading ? "Loading..." : "Loaded"}) should extract 2 strings
